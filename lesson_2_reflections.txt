What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git init creates a repository. You need a repository to store files in a group and
	track changes using "git status".

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is the area I can add and remove files. Once I add and remove, I can make
	a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	You can use the staging area to add and delete changes before you make a commit.
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	When you want to make a variation of the file that is like an experiment.
	
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	It helps me visualize where the branches begin and to see which commits are connected
	and unconnected.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	The branch that is merged becomes a part of the master branch. Using the diagram, we
	find where the new branch began and where it was merged. The head of the master branch
	is changed when you merge.
	
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
