When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use a remote repository to allow others to access my files from different 
  places. This will allow us to collaborate on potential projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote
repository?
	Because it gives me the choice to share what I want. For instance, I might not want to
	a certain file publicly until its done. We can also make logical pushes on to GitHub.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are a way to get someone else's repository on Github onto your own Github
	account. You can make your own changes through forks and even submit them to the 
	original maker. Clones are a way to transfer repositories from Github to my computer.
	Branches are a way to make changes on a separate series of commits.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	If you have a local copy, than you can always revert to it if your origin/master gets
	messed up.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Using GitHub to collaborate would be so much easier!!! We would be efficient because
	branches allows us to work and merge very easily, unlike Scratch.
